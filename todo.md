# Things to do

1. Split date identification and numeric preprocessing.

# Nice but not mandatory

1. Configure main MySugr account to automatically resend csv files to bot email account.
2. Change scopes of Python mail token.
3. Implement basal analysis.
4. Fully automate data sync and preprocessing (incremental sync behaviour).
  * This has been practically achieved, maybe modifying the lock behaviour would be better.

# Achieved

1. Interpolation.
